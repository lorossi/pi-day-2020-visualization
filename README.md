# PI Day 2020 - a visualization
## A simple yet fascinating way of visualizing the first million digits of PI

Visualizing the first million digits of PI in a colorful (and round) way, in honor of the 2020 PI day.  
This code will generate an image like this:

![PI visualization](https://github.com/lorossi/pi-day-2020-visualization/blob/master/rendered/pi-title-1000px_rescaled.png)  

The code can be tweaked in multiple way to get a different output. Currently, it generates a 10000 pixels x 10000 pixels PNG image using 1 million of pi digits (found in the _pi.txt_ file inside the _data_ folder).
You can run the program by yourself (mind that it will be quite slow) or view the full-size image in the _rendered_ folder (very big, about 63MB).  

The font used is [_Roboto_ by _Christian Robertson_.](https://github.com/google/roboto/)
